<+S>: From this project, I strengthened my skills in defining private variables, and accessing
      these variables. I also learned how to define set and get methods as well as how to use
      overloading methods. It allows the program to look cleaner, as well as making the
      program easier to use.


<-S>: In the beginning, I had forgotten how to make different overloading methods. I had also
      defined these methods wrong, and had to refer to my notes as well as the programs
      provided by FLVS.

In the future: I will make sure to look over all of the different practice programs provided,
               as they cover the concepts really well, and show an application of the concepts
               taught in the lessons.
