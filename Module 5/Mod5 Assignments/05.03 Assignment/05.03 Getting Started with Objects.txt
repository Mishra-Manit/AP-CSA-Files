05.03 Getting Started with Objects 



Pick one of the listed categories and name three more objects that it might include.

Category: Inside Objects

Object 1: bed   Object 2: printer   Object 3: shelf

Think of an unlisted category and identify five objects that it might include.

New Category:  body parts

Object 1: lungs   Object 2: hands   Object 3: feet

Object 4: head   Object 5: hair

Pick any object and make a list of five "sub-objects" the category might contain. For example, a dancer object is itself a category and could include a folk dancer, a Salsa dancer, a ballroom dancer, break dancer, and an ice dancer, etc.

Object: engineer

Sub-Object 1: Software Engineer   Sub-Object 2: Hardware Engineer

Sub-Object 3: Electrical Engineer   Sub-Object 4: Chemical Engineer

Sub-Object 5: Automotive Engineer

Pick any object and list four of its physical characteristics (i.e. attributes) and two things it can do (i.e. behaviors). In terms of "behaviors," think in terms of actions (verbs). For example, dancers can spin, dogs can bark, boats can sink. Don't be too literal with the term behavior; have some fun with it.

Object: Basketball players

Attribute 1: jersey     Attribute 2: shoes

Attribute 3: socks     Attribute 4: basketball

Behavior 1: jump     Behavior 2: dribble

In your own words, given what you know now, how do you define an object?

An object is a broad term which can have subcategories.
