<+S>: After finishing this assignment, I got a better feel of how to use Increment Operators
      and Escape Characters. These two things made my code look much neater and organized. I
      also learned how to use the (double) and (int). These helped a lot with casting.


<-S>: In the beginning I had a lot of trouble with casting and increment operators. After
      practicing for a little bit, I got the hang of it.

In the future: I kept forgetting to put comments on my code. So in the future, I will make
               to put comments next to my code right after I type the code.
