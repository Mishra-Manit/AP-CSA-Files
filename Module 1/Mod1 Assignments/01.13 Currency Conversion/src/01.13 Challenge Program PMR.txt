<+S>: After finshing this assignment, I got more familiar with using different arithmetic
      operators. I also got some practice in using casting to make sure that the output is
      either an int, or a double.


<-S>: I messed up many times in formatting the print statements. I also messed up many times
      in writing the proper formulas in the proper places. I also need to work on defining the
      right variables in the right parts of the code.


**********************************************************************************************

In the future: I will makes sure to spend some time to practice formatting print statements, so
               it is not as hard next time. I will also make sure to make the code look nicer
               by defining the variables in the right places.
