<+S>: From this program, I stengthened my skills in opening and reading files. I also got
      practice on the different types of methods that can be used in opening and calling
      different text files.


<-S>: I kept forgetting the "Scanner inFile = new Scanner(fileName);" line, and I had to go
      back to examples that were previously provided in order to find why my code was working.

In the future: When I am learned a new topic that was not covered previously, I will make a
               copy of the program in my notes, so that I can refer back to the notes, and see
               how to format the code. I will also pay attention to the small details of the code
               and make sure I have each aspect of the code.
