************************************P M R****************************************************

<+S>: From this lesson, I learned how to call and define methods. I also learned how to set
      parameters in these methods, and how to use the parameters. I also learned about the
      different types of methods such as void methods with methods, without methods, and with
      return.


<-S>: I kept forgetting how to call the methods, and needed to refer back to my notes quite a
      bit. I also had trouble with the return method, and how to call it.


**********************************************************************************************

In the future: I will make sure to take more thorough notes, because I refer back to them quite
               a bit. I will also make sure to go through the lesson closely, because there were
               many small details that were helpful later on.
