PROJECT TITLE:
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create a mock election project to demonstrate traversal algorithms, using the
                    results of a mock election with an arrays and ArrayList. Display all results
                    of an election with select candidates. Also make classes in order to change
                    all of the different aspects of these different candidates. Do all of this
                    with the use of Arrays and ArrayLists.

************************************P M R****************************************************

<+S>: I was able to put my previous knowledge of arrays and arrayLists to use. The assignment
      was fairly simple and easy as no main new concepts were introduced.


<-S>: I struggled to figure out how to set up the for loops, but after going through the lesson
      I figured out how to do them.

In the future: I will make sure to definitely take more time in reviewing the practice programs
               given because they often encompass the lesson best. It is also very helpful
               I am able to mess around with the program and get more familiar with the concepts
               covered.
