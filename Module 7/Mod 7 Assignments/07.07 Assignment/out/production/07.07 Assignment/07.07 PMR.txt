                    classes in order to change all of the different aspects of these

************************************P M R****************************************************

<+S>: I was able to understand a majority of the changes being done to the array. I was able
      to make use of the for loops in order to do everything I needed.


<-S>: I did not fully understand how to use the for loops in the Deletions lesson, and I had
      to go back and review it. I also had trouble understanding how to set up the for loop
      in order to delete things from the array.


**********************************************************************************************

In the future: Eventually after a lot of thinking and reviewing, I understood how the for-loops
               worked. For every chapter I will make sure to spend more time reviewing the concepts
               so that I completely understand what is going on.
